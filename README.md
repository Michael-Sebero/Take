## How Take Works
Take installs **your** AUR repos in a streamlined way. This is useful if you have packages on the AUR which need to be installed automatically with no prompting. **I don't suggest using this command on AUR packages which aren't yours due to safety concerns, use https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru instead for installing regular packages.**

```
take [ PACKAGE1 ] [ PACKAGE2 ]
```

## Requirements 
. git

. base-devel

## How to install Take
. Enter the command `su` into your terminal.

. Through the root terminal enter the name of your file manager.

. Place the Take command in your [ /bin ] folder.
